There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

Each tier is specified by defining the amount up to which the interest rate applies. Additionally, each tier can be of a different interest rate type (i.e. fixed, floating, or periodic). There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. Two calculations will be performed (i.e. 10 per cent on 10,000 and 15 per cent on 5,000) This field is Mandatory."},"prAttribute__":{"type":"string","description":""},"prValue__":{"type":"string","description":""},"linkedArrangement":{"type":"string","description":"Where at least one tier is set to be �Linked Rate�, the Arrangement to be linked for calculating the Interest Rate, must be specified here (or automatically defaulted by the system, where a Limit is attached)"},"linkedProperty":{"type":"string","description":"Indicates the interest property based on which the scheduled commission is calculated.

There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

Each tier is specified by defining the amount up to which the interest rate applies. Additionally, each tier can be of a different interest rate type (i.e. fixed, floating, or periodic). There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier.

Each tier is specified by defining the amount up to which the interest rate applies. Additionally, each tier can be of a different interest rate type (i.e. fixed, floating, or periodic). There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.

Each tier is specified by defining the amount up to which the interest rate applies. Additionally, each tier can be of a different interest rate type (i.e. fixed, floating, or periodic). There are three type of tiers; Single, Level, and Banded. Single Rate When a single rate tier type is specified a single nominal interest rate will apply for the entire balance amount. Rate Levels By specifying level tiers a product can be defined which will calculate interest at different rates depending on the balance amount. A single rate of interest will be selected and applied based upon the balance amount. For example for a deposit a single product can have a higher rate of interest for accounts which maintain higher credit balances. Conversely for a loan product a higher rate of interest can be charged for accounts with higher debit balances. For example, aassuming a credit balance of 15,000 and level interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000. A single rate of 15 per cent will be applied to the entire amount of 15,000. Banded Rates Banded tier interest will typically result in a blended interest rate. This is similar to Level tiers, but allows for the interest rate of each tier to be applied to the portion of the balance that falls within the tier. For example, assuming a credit balance of 15,000 and banded interest which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.
